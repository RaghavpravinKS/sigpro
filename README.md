## Objective of our project
To design an android/iOS app for child safety monitoring. We aim to create an app that detects any over speeding, accidents and crossing of boundaries of a child riding a bicycle. 

## Simulink Model
We've created a Simulink model which takes input from phone's sensor and uses it to detect crash and overspeed detection of the bicycle. 

It continuously monitors the data from various sensors such as Gyroscope, Accelerometer, GPS sensor, Camera and microphone to get a sense of what's really happening around the phone.
